# Vibecrafted TUI Workspace

`vc-tui` is the standalone desktop/control workspace for Vibecrafted.
It carries the terminal cockpit, MCP multiplexer, tray agent, and macOS shell
wrapper as one Rust-first product surface.

## Workspace Shape

The root `Cargo.toml` is a workspace, not an application crate:

| Path | Package | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `mux-agent/` | `rust-mux` | MCP transport multiplexer and daemon supervisor |
| `tui-agent/` | `vc-tui` | terminal control cockpit |
| `tray-agent/` | `tray-agent` | menu bar/tray control surface |
| `shell-agent/ffi/` | `vibecrafted-shell-ffi` | Rust/UniFFI bridge for the macOS app |
| `shell-agent/uniffi-bindgen/` | `vibecrafted-uniffi-bindgen` | local binding generator wrapper |

The old root-level TUI crate was intentionally removed after extraction. The
single source of truth for the terminal cockpit is now `tui-agent/`.

## Quality Gates

Use the root Makefile:

```bash
make gates
cargo check --workspace
cargo check --workspace --all-features
cargo check --workspace --no-default-features
```

`make gates` runs:

```text
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## macOS App Build

The root app targets delegate to `shell-agent/`:

```bash
make app
make dmg
make dmg-signed
```

`make app` generates UniFFI bindings, regenerates the Xcode project through
`xcodegen`, builds `Vibecrafted.app`, and embeds the Rust helper binaries:

- `vc-mux-daemon`
- `vc-mux-tray`
- `vc-tui`

`make dmg` creates an unsigned local DMG. `make dmg-signed` requires a
Developer ID Application signing identity in the local keychain and prints the
notarization commands after a signed DMG is created.

## Runtime State Contract

The TUI reads the shared local control-plane state:

```text
$VIBECRAFTED_HOME/control_plane/
  runs/*.json
  events.jsonl
```

The mux status panel reads `rust-mux` JSON status snapshots, preferring
`VIBECRAFTED_MUX_STATUS_PATHS` before defaulting to
`~/.rmcp_servers/rust_mux/status.json` and sibling JSON files.

## Repository Rule

This repo is a living tree. Do not commit build products, `.loctree` snapshots,
`.DS_Store`, Xcode DerivedData, generated daily artifact symlinks, or nested
source-repo CI baggage. Keep `Cargo.lock` tracked: this is an application and
release workspace, not only a library crate.
